# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/en-in)
- [TomTom API](https://www.tomtom.com/)
- [Haversine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/haversine)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [Sentry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/browser)
